Data Science project to compare countries on Index of Economic Freedom

# Dataset Editing

The original 2022 dataset from [Heritage.org](https://www.heritage.org/index/download) does not include data about the World average, therefore, I manually added it with `ID` = _187_, but I keep many variable as N/A due to not knowing how to compute some or where to find them. However, I was able to compute and add the most relevant data for this project.
